= Vert.x-hazelcast-client
:toc: left

Vert.x-hazelcast-client allows Vert.x applications to interact with a [Hazelcast](http://hazelcast.org) cluster.

This module currently supports a few Hazelcast features, implemented with respect to Vert.x threading model and async
invocation style:
* ``IMap`` data access
* ``IAtomicLong``

= Development & testing
TODOs:
* Introduce ``HazelcastOptions`` data object for JSON config of Hazelcast client (look into existing hazelcast node.js
client for consistency)
* Support ``AsyncAtomicReference``
* Support for generic ``DistributedObject`` proxies
* Listeners support

Tests should extend ``AbstractHazelcastClientTest`` which starts and shuts down an embedded Hazelcast member before / after
test class' tests.
